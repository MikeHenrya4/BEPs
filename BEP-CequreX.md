Abstract
BEP-CequreX introduces a blockchain-based framework for representing IT, OT, and IoT device configurations as non-fungible, versioned assets on BNB Chain. Each configuration is bound to a specific device through cryptographic hashes and governed by a strict lifecycle: Pending → Approved → Active → Deprecated.
It mandates hardware-backed signatures (via HSMs or TPMs) for all state transitions, endorses multi-curve cryptographic schemes, including post-quantum algorithms, and explicitly recommends non-transferability to preserve device linkage. This positions BEP-CequreX to meet compliance standards such as NIS2, NERC-CIP, and ISO 27001 while anticipating future security shifts.

Motivation
Industries like energy, healthcare, and advanced manufacturing rely on configuration management processes that lack immutable lineage, device-specific assurance, or hardware-enforced cryptographic validation. Existing GitOps workflows or SIEM drift detection cannot guarantee tamper-evident rollback or protect against quantum-capable threats.
BEP-CequreX addresses this gap by enforcing a device-bound, lifecycle-managed framework anchored on a decentralized ledger. For example, it can prevent deployment of unapproved PLC firmware or critical sensor baselines that have not passed multi-party HSM-backed approval, reducing operational and compliance risk.

Specification
This section details the core data structures and lifecycle functions that enable non-fungible configuration governance under BEP-CequreX.

Configuration Structure
struct Configuration {
    uint256 tokenId;
    string configHash;
    string deviceId;
    uint256 parentTokenId;
    string schemaURI;
    ConfigStatus status;
    address createdBy;
    uint256 timestamp;
}

Lifecycle Status
enum ConfigStatus {
    Pending,
    Approved,
    Active,
    Deprecated
}

Core Functions
•   createConfiguration(...)
•   approveConfiguration(uint256 tokenId)
•   deployConfiguration(uint256 tokenId)
•   deprecateConfiguration(uint256 tokenId)
•   getLineage(uint256 tokenId)
•   getConfiguration(uint256 tokenId)
These enable cryptographically enforced transitions that maintain historical traceability.

Events
event ConfigurationCreated(uint256 indexed tokenId, string deviceId, address indexed creator);
event ConfigurationApproved(uint256 indexed tokenId, address indexed approver);
event ConfigurationDeployed(uint256 indexed tokenId, string deviceId);
event ConfigurationDeprecated(uint256 indexed tokenId);

Security Extensions
•   HSM / TPM Enforcement: Lifecycle operations must be signed by private keys stored within certified hardware modules, establishing hardware-rooted trust anchors.
•   Multi-curve Cryptography: Implementers should support ECDSA, lattice-based schemes (such as CRYSTALS-DILITHIUM, FALCON), or hybrid composite signatures, ensuring cryptographic agility and readiness for quantum threats. Future upgrades should be straightforward.
•   Explicit Non-Transferability: Configuration tokens should be non-transferable (soulbound) to preserve device-to-config lineage and block unauthorized reassignment.

Rationale
This standard provides device-specific governance with immutable rollbacks and audit-proof lineage. Multi-curve cryptographic support ensures the system can transition to new security primitives as threats evolve, guaranteeing a durable compliance foundation without modifying core governance.

Compatibility
BEP-CequreX extends BEP-721, maintaining compatibility with the existing NFT ecosystem for tracking and metadata standards, while specializing these mechanics for non-transferable, compliance-grade configuration assets.

Security Considerations
•   Enforce strict role-based permissions and consider multi-signature schemes for critical lifecycle operations.
•   Implementers should design systems for cryptographic agility, allowing new algorithms or curves to be adopted without disruptive migrations.

Optional Implementation Notes
Systems may incorporate Merkle roots, zero-knowledge proofs, or external attestations for batch audit anchoring, although these are outside BEP-CequreX’s normative requirements.

Intellectual Property Notice
Portions of this standard are also described in U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 63/844,071, filed July 15, 2025, by Michael Henry. Cequra intends to license any necessary patents on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms to encourage broad ecosystem adoption.

Open Questions
•   Should the standard mandate native support for auditor or regulatory signatures in the contract itself?
•   Is it beneficial to enforce hybrid multi-curve (ECDSA + PQC) signatures by default, or keep these purely optional?
•   Would explicit hooks for connecting to third-party registries (compliance hubs, vendor certifications) strengthen device lineage assurance?
•   How should legacy environments with minimal HSM/TPM support approach minimal compliance under this framework?

Summary
BEP-CequreX defines a tamper-evident, quantum-ready, hardware-anchored governance model for managing critical device configurations on BNB Chain, enabling developers and compliance teams to achieve operational integrity and regulatory confidence.
